                            <p class="text-center">The history of coffee dates back centuries, first from its origin in Ethiopia and Yemen. 
                                It was already known in Mecca in the 15th century. Also, in the 15th century, Sufi Muslim monasteries in Yemen employed 
                                coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant in the early 16th century, 
                                it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. 
                                Coffee came to Italy in the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, 
                                while Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached 
                                India and the East Indies.</p>

                                were established in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in Holland, England, and Germany. One of the 
                                earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. 
                                These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands such as Saint-Domingue 
                                and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee.</p>
                            <p class="text-center">By 1852, Brazil became the world's largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. 
                                Since 1950, several other major producers emerged, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. 
                                the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999.</p>

                            certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a
                            stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which
                            transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine
                            particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing
